I've cried and cried for hours,
I've cried and cried for days,
I've tried to save what's ours,
You lied in many ways,

How can you blame me for the past,
No wonder we didn't last
If you want to know just how I feel,
It's got to be for real.

It's got to be for real

I've cried and cried for years
And hid away my fears,
Lived a lie for so long, yeah,
How could I be so wrong

When you blame me for the past,
No wonder we didn't last, no no,
Life's all about just how you feel,
It's got to be for real.

It's got to be for real x7

Life's all about just how you feel x3
It's got to be for real x8
Is it real?

Why, why, why, why ... x2
