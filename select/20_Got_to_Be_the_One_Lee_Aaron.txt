I had a dream, you took me there, ooh, ooh
If I was lost you'd lead me, where I was goin'...
I never thought it could feel so true.
All the things that I' been through ooh, ooh

No pretendin'...
I'm a victim.
Oh I'm a victim of you...

I took a chance, I let you in, ooh, ooh
You washed away the tears, when I was cryin'...
Like the silence after the storm
Hot an' cold when passion's warm ooh, ooh

Neverendin'...
I'm addicted
I'm addicted to love...

Oh you're
(You're the only one)
You've got to be the one
(Takes me through the night...)
Oh you're
You're the only one)
You've got to be the one
(To hold you feels so right...)

I had a dream, you took me there, ooh, ooh
If I was blind you'd take me, where I was goin'...
I never thought it could feel so true
All the things that I' been through ooh, ooh

No pretendin' anymore
I'm a victim.
Oh I'm a victim of you...

Oh you're
(You're the only one)
You've got to be the one.
(Takes me through the night...)
Oh you're
(You're the only one)
You've got to be the one.
(To hold you feels so right...)

Oh no
(You're the only one)
You've got to be the one.
(Takes me through the night...)
Oh no
(You're the only one)
You've got to be the one.
(To hold you feels so right...)

Ah-ahh... got to be the one
Ah-ahh... got to be the one
Ah-ahh... got to be the one
Ah-ahh... got to be the one
Ah-ahh... got to be the one
Ah-ahh... got to be the one
