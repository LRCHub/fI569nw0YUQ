[00:05.50] I'm out late every night
[00:14.67] Doing things that ain't right
[00:16.46] And she'll cry for me
[00:21.97] When I'm down in the dumps
[00:24.67] And she nurses my lumps
[00:27.33] How she cries for me
[00:37.33] 
[00:32.80] And she'll never complain
[00:35.53] She keeps hiding the pain
[00:38.20] But I know all the while
[00:43.62] She's not feeling too well
[00:46.43] 'Cause I put her through hell
[00:49.14] Still she forces a smile
[01:01.14] 
[00:54.54] She's got to be a saint
[00:58.21] Lord know that I ain't
[01:04.56] I finally realize
[01:08.29] Right before my eyes
[01:10.96] Here is a saint
[01:18.46] 
[01:16.39] There's a dress in a shop
[01:19.98] That'll make her eyes pop
[01:21.85] But she'll look away
[01:26.38] She'd have gotten a lift
[01:29.04] If I'd bought her that gift
[01:31.72] For her birthday
[01:39.72] 
[01:37.22] But her birthday has come
[01:39.98] And I feel like a bum
[01:42.67] 'Cause I spent my last dime
[01:48.14] On a worthless old friend
[01:51.76] On a drunken weekend
[01:54.45] I've done it time after time
[02:08.45] 
[01:59.04] She's got to be a saint
[02:02.60] Lord know that I ain't
[02:09.96] I finally realize
[02:12.61] Right before my eyes
[02:16.27] Here is a saint
[02:23.77] 
[02:26.23] Should I stay? Should I go?
[02:28.99] I really don't know
[02:30.71] My mind's in a blur
[02:36.25] Soon it's gonna be dawn
[02:38.93] And if she finds me gone
[02:42.61] Would it be best for her?
[02:55.11] 
[02:47.16] I see her cry in her sleep
[02:49.86] So I kiss her wet cheek
[02:52.55] I kneel by her and pray
[02:58.01] And I'll turn off the light
[03:00.77] Step out in the night
[03:03.42] And I'll go on my way
[03:13.92] 
[03:08.99] She's got to be a saint
[03:12.53] Lord know that I ain't
[03:18.82] I finally realize
[03:22.57] Right before my eyes
[03:25.29] Here is a saint
